# TOPSIS Package for Decision Making

## Overview

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making method that helps in ranking and selecting alternatives based on their relative closeness to the ideal solution. This Python-based implementation processes input data, calculates the TOPSIS scores, and provides ranked results.

## Features

- Accepts CSV files as input with a well-defined format.
- Handles custom weights and impacts for each criterion.
- Validates the correctness of input data.
- Outputs a CSV file containing the TOPSIS scores and ranks.
- Ensures robust error handling for incorrect inputs and missing files.
